# Unity Twitch Chat

This is a lightweight and efficient [Twitch.tv IRC](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) client for Unity.

In short, this allows you to integrate Twitch Chat to your Unity projects.<br>The primary goal is to be able to read and send chat messages as efficiently as possible.

- Bits cheering, channel points, predictions, etc
- Moderation (ban, timeout, etc)
- Third party extensions (FFZ, BTTV, 7TV, etc)
- and more...

### Other limitations

## Installation

- Open Unity Package Manager <i>(Window -> Package Manager)</i>
- Click the `+` button in the top left corner
- Select `Add package from git URL...`
- Copy and paste the following URL and finish by clicking `Add`<br>
```
https://github.com/lexonegit/Unity-Twitch-Chat.git?path=/Unity-Twitch-Chat/Assets/Package
```


## Quick start
1. Install the Unity package (see above)
2. Create a new empty GameObject and add the `Twitch IRC` component.
3. In the inspector, set your Twitch details (OAuth, username, channel) 
    - You can generate an OAuth token at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
    - Alternatively you can enable `Use Anonymous Login` to use without OAuth
4. Make sure `Connect IRC On Start` and `Join Channel On Start` are enabled and press play â€“ You should now see JOIN messages, etc. in the console.
5. Create a new script that has a listener for the `IRC.OnChatMessage` event.
    - See <a href="https://github.com/lexonegit/Unity-Twitch-Chat/blob/main/Unity-Twitch-Chat/Assets/ExampleProject/ListenerExample.cs">ListenerExample.cs</a> for reference.
    -  The listener will receive `Chatter` objects which contain information about each chat message, such as the chatter name, message, emotes, etc...
