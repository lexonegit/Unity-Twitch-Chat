In short, this allows you to integrate Twitch Chat to your Unity projects.<br>The primary goal is to be able to read and send chat messages as efficiently as possible.

## Quick start
1. Install the Unity package (see above)
2. Create a new empty GameObject and add the `Twitch IRC` component.
3. In the inspector, set your Twitch authentication details (OAuth, username, channel) 
You can generate an OAuth token at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
OAuth and username are not needed if `Use Anonymous Login` is enabled. 
4. Make sure `Connect On Start` is enabled and press play â€“ You should now see JOIN messages, etc. in the console.
5. To start handling chat messages, add a listener to the `IRC.OnChatMessage` event. The listener will receive `Chatter` objects which contain information about the chat message, such as the chatter name, message, emotes, etc...
